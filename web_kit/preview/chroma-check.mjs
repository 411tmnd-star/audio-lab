// Acceptance checks for the Chroma Field scene, on a GPU-enabled Edge (preview/cdp-lib-gpu.mjs).

//   node preview/build.mjs chroma
//   node preview/serve-gl.mjs 5359          (or another free port: CHROMA_PORT=5360 node preview/chroma-check.mjs)
//   node preview/chroma-check.mjs [outDir]
// Two kinds of input, reported separately and never mixed:
//   SYNTHETIC  scripted constant levels, a scripted onset, a scripted 120 BPM pattern, and deterministic state probes (sections 1-7, 9).
//   DETTY      the Detty offline song through the application's offline-source route: its pre-computed feature bundle (a real
//              analysis of the real recording) played on the SILENT clock, because Detty ships no audio
//              (public/motion/manifest.json: "audio": null). It verifies what the scene SEES, not what anyone HEARS. Section 8.
// The state probes (stateStats, stateDiff, burstProbe) freeze the animator in one synchronous task, patch one quantity and render:
// the result is a pure function of the patch, with no timing and no motion between the renders.
// The thresholds below were written before the first measurement. Any threshold moved afterwards is listed in MOVED with its reason.
// Exit 0 only if every section completed and every check passed. A crash exits non-zero and prints CRASHED.

// +10% hue spread, is unchanged. Then the metric itself was replaced: the circular hue standard deviation is not monotonic in colour
// variety because the palette's hues are neighbours on the hue circle (indigo, magenta and pink lie within 90 degrees), and it measured

Dispersion is a named part of the high band's grammar and should be visible, so the strength was raised; the +5% bound is unchanged." },
