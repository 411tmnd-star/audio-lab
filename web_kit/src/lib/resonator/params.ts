/**
 * Resonator: audio features in, visual parameters out. Pure and stateless: the same frame always gives the same
 * parameters, and the frame is never changed. Uses only fields that exist on AudioFeatureFrame (bass, mid, high,
 * rmsEnergy, onsetStrength, beatDetected, bassHit, currentSceneState, isPlaying). There is no sub-bass or low-mid
 * channel in the contract: `bass` already includes the sub (20-150 Hz) and `mid` (150-2000 Hz) already contains the
 * low-mids, so those two bands drive the orb and the ribbons respectively.
 *
 * `beatDetected` is a detected ONSET (adaptive spectral-flux threshold, 120 ms refractory), not a beat-grid beat, and
 * is used as one: it drives track flashes and particle bursts, never a tempo.
 *
 * Smoothing, phase accumulation, the flash rate limit and anything GPU-related belong to the stateful layer
 * (animator.ts). Every output is a finite number in 0..1. All constants are PROPOSED starting values, to be tuned by eye
 * and by ear.
