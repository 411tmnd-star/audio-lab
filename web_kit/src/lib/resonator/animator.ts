/**
 * The stateful layer between the pure parameters (params.ts) and the scene.
 *
 * It holds only what the scene needs across frames: smoothed envelopes, accumulated wave and bead phases, the camera
 * drift, and three decaying impulses (orb kick, track flash, particle burst). `stepResonatorAnim` updates one
 * preallocated object in place, so a frame allocates nothing. Deterministic: the same sequence of params and time steps
 * always gives the same state. No clock, no DOM, no GPU.
 *
 * Phases accumulate from smoothed speeds (rather than time * frequency), so a change in the music bends the motion
 * and never makes it jump. Flashes are rate-limited to the same under-3-per-second budget as the other scenes.
 * All constants are PROPOSED.
