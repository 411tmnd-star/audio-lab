 * Everything here is an instantaneous reading. Temporal smoothing, phase accumulation, the flare rate limit
 * and anything GPU-related belong to a later stateful layer, not to this function.
 *
 * Every output is a finite number in 0..1. A renderer maps 0..1 onto its own units (scale, speed, colour).
 *
 * The constants are PROPOSED starting values, chosen to give a clear response and a dim resting state. None of
 * them has been checked for perceptual quality; that needs a visual review with real audio.
