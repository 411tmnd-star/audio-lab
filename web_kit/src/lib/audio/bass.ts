/**
 * Turns the raw bass-band level (dB) into the pull that moves the cluster.
 *
 * 1. Adaptive window: the level is scaled between a slowly tracked floor and peak, so quiet and loud
 *    songs both use the full range. The fixed window in the first version could clip loud masters and
 *    flatten quiet ones.
 * 2. Sustain and transient: the slow body of the bass is separated from the fast excursions above it.
 *    Kicks are the transients, so a sustained bass line pulls steadily without pumping, and kicks
 *    pulse on top.
 * 3. Two paths. The sustained body drives a damped spring, so the cluster overshoots slightly and settles,
 *    which reads as a physical pull. Kicks bypass the spring and decay directly, because a spring always
 *    lags its input (about 150 ms at 4 Hz) and that lag pushes the visible hit off the beat.
