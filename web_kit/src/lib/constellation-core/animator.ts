/**
 * The stateful layer between the pure parameters (params.ts) and the scene.
 *
 * It holds only what the scene needs across frames: smoothed envelopes, the accumulated orbit phase, the camera drift,
 * the beam impulse with its decay, and the ring pulse with its rate limit. `stepCoreAnim` updates one preallocated
 * object in place, so a frame allocates nothing. Deterministic: the same sequence of params and time steps always gives
 * the same state. No clock, no DOM, no GPU.
 *
 * Copied and adapted from Accretion's animator (`jet` is `beam`, `flare` is `pulse`). All constants are PROPOSED.
