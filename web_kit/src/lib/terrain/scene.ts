/**
 * The Terrain scene: one connected, subdivided heightfield, seen from a fixed oblique camera above its near edge. Newest relief
 * enters at the near edge and recedes along Z; the surface is displaced in the vertex shader by the heights the history stored.
 *
 * Built once in the constructor: a static grid geometry (positions are placeholders; the shader places every vertex), one
 * ShaderMaterial, one float DataTexture that shares the history's own array (no copy). `update` writes uniforms and flags the
 * texture for upload only when the history wrote a row. A frame allocates nothing. `dispose` releases the geometry, material
 * and texture; `releaseGpu` does the same for a lost context while keeping the scene graph.
 *
 * `decor: false` switches off everything that is not the surface itself (contour lines, register tints, edge line, horizon
 * fade, shockwave): what is left is the heightfield shaded by slope, the geometry that carries the identity.
 * Sizes and rates are PROPOSED values for visual review.
