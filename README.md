# Audio Lab

[![CI](https://github.com/411tmnd-star/audio-lab/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/411tmnd-star/audio-lab/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Live demo: [audio-lab-git-main-411-004b.vercel.app](https://audio-lab-git-main-411-004b.vercel.app)** (pick a visual, then press Demo, choose a pre-analysed song, or use your microphone)

Audio Lab turns a song into a live, music-driven visual. A Python pipeline analyses the audio (tempo, beats, bars, spectral bands, onsets) and interprets it. A browser app then plays that analysis through four real-time visuals built with React, TypeScript and Three.js.

| Squall: a weather map | Accretion: a black hole |
|---|---|
| ![Squall](docs/media/squall.gif) | ![Accretion](docs/media/accretion.gif) |
| **Constellation Core: a planetary system** | **Spectrum Matrix: a terrain** |

*Each clip is the built-in synthetic 120 BPM demo, recorded in headless Edge on integrated graphics.*

All four read the same audio features, so any song drives any visual. Constellation Core and Spectrum Matrix share a source picker: a built-in demo, three pre-analysed songs, an uploaded file or the microphone.

## How it works

    audio file
       |
       v
    1. analyze          tempo, beats, bars, band energy, onsets        -> song_analysis.json
       |
    2. interpret        rule-based reading of the analysis             -> song_interpretation.json
       |
    3. visual mapping   audio features -> visual signals (3 profiles)
       |
    4. motion           scene states (rest, build, active, settle)     -> motion timeline
       |
    5. export           compact bundles for the browser                -> web_kit/public/motion/
       |
       v
    browser app         plays the timeline, or analyses live audio, and drives the visuals

Every stage writes a versioned JSON artifact validated against a schema in `schemas/`. The analysis stage is deterministic: the same audio and configuration give byte-identical arrays.

## Verification

- Python: 388 tests (pytest).
- Browser kit: 263 unit tests, a clean TypeScript check, and real-browser checks with a GPU: 70 for Constellation Core, 60 for Spectrum Matrix and 13 for the live-versus-offline pipeline.
- Both new visuals hold 60 fps on integrated graphics (median frame 16.7 ms).

Details, numbers and how unusual input is handled are in [docs/engineering](docs/engineering/README.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/audiolab/` | Python package: analysis, interpretation, visual mapping, motion, CLI |
| `web_kit/` | Browser app and the four visuals ([design notes](web_kit/DESIGN.md)) |
| `designs/` | Per-visual notes and screenshots: `accretion/`, `constellation-core/`, `spectrum-matrix/` |
| `samples/` | Real pipeline output for three songs (JSON and plots) |
| `configs/`, `schemas/` | Analysis, interpretation, motion and visual-profile configs; versioned JSON schemas |
| `tests/`, `scripts/` | Python tests; the export script and the upload-demo server |
| `docs/` | [Visualizer architecture](docs/architecture/visualizer-guide.md), [engineering notes](docs/engineering/README.md), [planning](docs/planning/) (upgrade spec and analysis), demo clips |

## Run it

Python 3.10 or later and Node 22.7 or later (developed on Node 24).

    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows PowerShell
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
    python -m pytest

Analyse a song and open the upload demo:

    audiolab --help
    python scripts/demo_server.py         # http://localhost:8765, see DEMO.md

Browser kit, from `web_kit/`:

    npm install
    npm test
    node preview/build.mjs                # bundle the previews
    node preview/serve.mjs 5353           # Squall at http://localhost:5353/squall
    node preview/serve-gl.mjs 5354        # /accretion, /core and /matrix on port 5354
    npm run build:site                    # the static demo site, written to web_kit/site/

## Notes

- Audio files are not included. Supply files you have permission to use; the visuals also run on a built-in synthetic demo and the microphone.
- [`docs/planning/upgrade-spec.md`](docs/planning/upgrade-spec.md) is the planning document for the next upgrade round.
