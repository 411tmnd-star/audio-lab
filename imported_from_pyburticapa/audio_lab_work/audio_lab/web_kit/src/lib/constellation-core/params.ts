 * Constellation Core: audio features in, visual parameters out. Pure and stateless: the same frame always gives the

 * Temporal smoothing, phase accumulation, the pulse rate limit and anything GPU-related belong to the stateful layer
 * (animator.ts), not here. Every output is a finite number in 0..1.
 *
 * Shape and constants are copied from Accretion's params (kept separate on purpose, so neither scene depends on the
 * other). All constants are PROPOSED starting values; none has been checked with real music.
